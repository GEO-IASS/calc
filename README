Add dev database settings to calc-core/src/main/resources/dev.properties.

IMPORTANT: When making updates to the database schema, ALWAYS ADD A Liquibase 
           MIGRATION TO calc-core/design/db/changelog.  These will be automatically run
           when building during Maven's "process-resources" phase.           
           See http://www.liquibase.org/quickstart.html for more details.
